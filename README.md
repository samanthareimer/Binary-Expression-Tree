# Binary Expression Tree
This project implements a Binary Expression Tree in C++ to convert inputted postfix expressions into infix expressions using recursive algorithms. The program supports error handling, printing, counting nodes and leaves, and memory management.

## How to Compile & Execute
### Compilation
To compile this project, run the following in your terminal:
```bash
make
```
This will build the executable BET.x

### Execution
After compiling, run the program with: 
```bash
make run
```
This will execute the Binary Expression Tree program and allow you to input a postfix expression you want to be converted to infix.

## Makfile Description
- **Make**: Builds the executable "BET.x" by compiling source files.
- **Clean**: Removes the unwanted executable and object files.
- **run**: Runs the executable BET.x
Use make clean to remove generated object and executable files.
